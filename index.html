			<h2>Quantum Rays (Q-Rays)</h2>
      <p>Quantum Rays is an assimilation of computing, communications, security with wide-spread applications rapidly developing globally and lots of commercial applications emerging from theoretical constructs developing in this area. Quantum Rays is enabled by the transmission of information-carrying photons; the technology being considered as one of the most promising solutions for the future. While sharing several features and aspirations, quantum communication is an area of active research in its own right. To extrapolate considerably, the eventual goal may be a quantum internet wherein quantum information is transmitted with only acceptable losses across large distances and then transduced across different physical realizations so that quantum computers can essentially communicate to each other. Quantum Rays is expected to open platforms to perform tasks that are intractable for conventional machines, with the future quantum computers capable of doing it in a few seconds. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
      <p>Q-RAYS discusses the communication facets towards the next generation transformative quantum technologies that include quantum computers and computing, quantum communication, quantum key distribution, encryption, cryptanalysis, quantum devices, quantum sensing, quantum materials, quantum clock and so on. This one day symposium focuses on how to network quantum processors and quantum information for quantum control. The event aims to deliver quantum based networking solutions and discusses the challenges and opportunities with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers.</p>
